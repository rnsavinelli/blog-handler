[VERSION 0.1]

- The initialization mechanism has been modified.
- Most functions have been renamed to follow a different coding style with private functions having an underscore prepended.
- A new `_usageinfo()` function was introduced to make the code more readable.
- A new `_list()` function was introduced to make the code more extensible.
- `_listandReturn()` has been renamed to `_listandPrompt()`, and modified to make use of `_list()`.
- Defaulting selection when a single entry was listed by lb was removed.
- All HTML, CSS, RSS files were modified to mirror mine.
- The README.md file was altered to reflect how nlb works.
- When possible the code has been decompressed. i.e.:

    confirm() { read -erp "Really $1 \"$base\"? (y/N) " choice && echo "$choice" | grep -qi "^y$" || exit 1;}

    Became:

    confirm() {
        read -erp "Really $1 \"$base\"? (y/N) " choice && echo "$choice" | grep -qi "^y$" || exit 1
    }
